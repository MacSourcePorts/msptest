MSP Test
======

This is a test repository I'm using to try and debug why buildbot is not picking up on release tags. 

If you have stumbled across this, it's basically the source code to [bstone](https://github.com/bibendovsky/bstone) because I know that builds properly. The only changes I'll be making are to this readme and to make tag versions. 

### Commit #1

Initial commit to get things rolling. No tags yet. 

### Commit #2 (TAG: v1.0 VERSION: 1.0)

The buildbot thing I'm trying to do fails if there's no tags so I'm going to call this one 1.0 with a tag of v1.0
